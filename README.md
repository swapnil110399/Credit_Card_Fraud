# Credit_Card_Fraud
The data set has 31 features, 28 of which have been anonymized and are labeled V1 through V28. The remaining three features are the time and the amount of the transaction as well as whether that transaction was fraudulent or not.
This project covers credit card fraud and is meant to look at a dataset of transactions and predict whether it is fraudulent or not. 
As the dataset is very unbalanced we would be using IsolationForest and LocalOutlierFactor machine learning
algorithms
